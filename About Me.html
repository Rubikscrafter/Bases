    <dd>Ever since I started to listen to music, I wondered what instrument would fit me the best. I played the double bass for a few years in elementary school, but I didn't stick when I moved. It took me about three years to begin playing another instrument, and it ended up being the piano. Drawn to its beautiful sound, I began playing the piano, and it has stuck with me to this day.</dd>
